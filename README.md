Project aim and objective or description .
The project aim and objective is to develop and create a first person shooting game unreal
engine. As for now we would like to create a first person game where the player can play just
by shooting at targets and can have fun. There are going to be moving targets as well as
targets that stay at the exact spot. And after hitting the target the target should disappear by
adding a score to the total points and the target should disappear with a blast sound, we
created this game to get to know about game development and unreal engine 5 capabilities.
And as we work on it we found out that it is more than capable to create a first person game
very efficiently. We added a little menu where you can choose to quit, to start or to change
settings and we added some settings like mode (full screen , windowed , windowed full
screen ) , resolution , graphics etc .
In this project we have a small map that is based on the top floor of a building of our college
and you can move anywhere in the map to shoot at the targets as it's very hard to shoot the
targets as they are moving and the bullets have a projectile motion and the some targets are
very far to shoot from the spawn point .
Future scope :
1)It is just the starting of our game development we can reach to new height if we continue
work on the game we can build a game like aimlabs where the pro players and a lot of
normal players use to train their aim before playing the games like valorant and csgo.
2) we can even change and add bots in place of the targets and make them move in some
positions and we can make our gun more precise with recoil and speed and we can add a
corsair so that people will enjoy the game more.
3) as this is a there are a lot of possibilities we can go to for it and we can change or add
more and more functions according to the feedback of the players
4)we can create a more dynamic game and add concept of multiplayer and can let to have
them health and make them fight to each other as like in valorant or csgo , we can make a
more bigger and larger map with more and more details , can add a lot of functions like
healing , more guns , economy system , practice area , and a lot more the possibilities and
future scope is endless.
Project Implementation and design:
We created a simple shooting game in the first person using unreal engine 5 , In this game
there are moving and non moving targets .moving targets can move in straight or diagonal
line and all the targets have different speed . we created a map based on the roof of one of
the building of the college. And we created our whole project without using any coding as we
know unreal engine is a engine which provide necessary tools to build your own game
without using any coding we can use c++ to change the script but we did not used it in our
project . we created a little ui and a home screen as well as an options menu where you can
change few things like mode , resolution and graphics settings.
